# learning-computer-science
Congratulations! You have successfully stumbled upon my secret little GitHub repo which I created for the sole purpose of keeping track of my learning journey. My name is kraken55, and I started learning computer science and programming a few weeks ago. I want to be able to write complex, actually useful software, and eventually, I would like to get a job in this field. (TODO (maybe): longer introduction)

## Computer Science

      <td>I actually skipped this week, because I already have some basic programming experience (mainly from high school). You'll learn the basics of algorithmic thinking (that is, how to think like a computer) through a playful "programming" environment called <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu>Scratch</a>, where you create programs by connecting blocks as if you were solving a jigsaw puzzle. If you never programmed before, or feel like you'd benefit from it, complete it.</td>

      <td>Week 1</td>
      <td>This week, you'll learn C, a real programming language used by actual programmers. It was invented in the 1970s by an American computer scientist, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie>Dennis Ritchie</a> (with contributions from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson>Ken Thompson</a>). It stood the test of time, and is still used in some fields (like microcontrollers, which are really fun). You'll learn about the basics of text-based programming (as opposed to Scratch's visual approach), variables and operations (which are pretty much like in math), conditionals (which help the program decide what to do in specific circumstances) and loops (which allow for executing the same command many times over, which - you'll see - is very convenient in certain situations). The course moves pretty fast, so I might suggest breaking up the two and a half hour long lecture into smaller portions. In the problem sets, you'll use loops to draw complex shapes in the command line, create a program to help cashiers calculate the fewest number of coins to give back change, and implement <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm>Luhn's algorithm</a> which is used to check the validity of credit card numbers.</td>
