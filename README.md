# learning-computer-science
Congratulations! You have successfully stumbled upon my secret little GitHub repo which I created for the sole purpose of keeping track of my learning journey. My name is kraken55, and I started learning computer science and programming a few weeks ago. I want to be able to write complex, actually useful software, and eventually, I would like to get a job in this field. (TODO (maybe): longer introduction)

      <td>I actually skipped this week, because I already have some basic programming experience from high school. You'll learn the basics of algorithmic thinking (that is, how to think like a computer) through a playful "programming" environment called <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu>Scratch</a>, where you create programs by connecting blocks as if you were solving a jigsaw puzzle. If you never programmed before, or feel like you'd benefit from it, complete it.</td>
