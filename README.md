# learning-computer-science
Congratulations! You have successfully stumbled upon my secret little GitHub repo which I created for the sole purpose of keeping track of my learning journey. My name is kraken55, and I started learning computer science and programming a few weeks ago. I want to be able to write complex, actually useful software, and eventually, I would like to get a job in this field. (TODO (maybe): longer introduction)

## Computer Science

<p>TODO: write review when done</p>
<p font-s>Effort required: ★★★★☆</p>

      <td>I actually skipped this week, because I already have some basic programming experience (mainly from high school). You'll learn the basics of algorithmic thinking (that is, how to think like a computer) through a playful "programming" environment called <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu>Scratch</a>, where you create programs by connecting blocks as if you were solving a jigsaw puzzle. If you never programmed before, or feel like you'd benefit from it, complete it.</td>

      <td>Week 1</td>
      <td>This week, you'll learn C, a real programming language used by actual programmers. It was invented in the 1970s by an American computer scientist, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie>Dennis Ritchie</a> (with contributions from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson>Ken Thompson</a>). It stood the test of time, and is still used in some fields (like microcontrollers, which are really fun). 
        You'll learn about
        <ul>
          <li>The basics of <b>text-based programming</b>, as opposed to Scratch's visual approach</li>
          <li><b>Variables and mathematical operations</b> (which behave almost like in math)</li>
          <li><b>Conditional statements</b>, which help your program decide what to do in specific circumstances</li>
          <li><b>Loops</b>, which allow for executing the same command(s) many times over, which - you'll see - is very convenient in some cases</li>
        </ul>
        In the problem sets, you'll
        <ul>
          <li>Use loops to "draw" complex shapes in the command line using text</li>
          <li>create a program to calculate the fewest number of coins necessary to give back change</li>
          <li>implement the Luhn algorithm, which is used to check the validity of credit card numbers
        </ul>

      <td>Week 2</td>
      <td>This week, you'll learn about
          <ul>
            <li><b>Arrays</b>, a fundamental data structure which is used the group values of the same type</li>
            <li><b>Functions</b>, a way to deconstruct complicated code into (somewhat) independent chunks for clarity and convenience</li>
            <li><b>Command-line arguments</b>, which is a special way to provide input to your program
          </ul>
          In the problem sets, you'll
          <ul>
            <li>implement an algorithm which determines the reading level (in US grades) of a piece of text</li>
            <li>create a program that encrypts text using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher>Caesar cipher</a> (yes, that Caesar)</li>
            <li>create a program that encrypts text using the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher>substitution cipher</a></li>
